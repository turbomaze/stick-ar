StickAR
==

StickAR lets you make mixed-reality games using technology you already know how to use<sup>1</sup> for devices you already have in your pocket<sup>2</sup>.

Initially developed at Greylock Hackfest 2017 (in vanilla JS w/o any libraries ;)).

<small>[1] HTML5 and JavaScript</small>

<small>[2] Phones with a rear cameras and chrome browsers</small>

## Details
As exciting as augmented reality is, currently it's neither accessible to developers nor to users. Developers need to navigate new, complex libraries, and in practice, users only ever interact with AR thanks to Snapchat.

By allowing developers to make AR games in the _exact_ same way they would make an HTML5 game, StickAR drastically lowers the barrier of entry for people curious about AR, but not curious enough to dive headfirst into an actual library (_cough_) like ARKit.
